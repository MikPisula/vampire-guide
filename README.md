## Development setup

Project dependencies might be installed using [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/)
Refer to PDM documentation for:
- [PDM Installation](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation) 
- [Managing Dependencies](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/dependency/#manage-dependencies)

TLDR; install PDM then use the command `pdm sync` to install all dependencies.
